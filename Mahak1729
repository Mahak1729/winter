# Tron Hoodie 

## Summary

For my first-ever project, I am planning to make the Tron Hoodie . I am choosing it for the following reasons
- Relatively cheap to start out
- Relatively easy to do for someone of my level (which is pretty much nonexistent)
This looks cools and would allow me to delve deep into a world I was not exposed to when I was young. Who could refuse to make something that looks so
cool and could be used in your daily life.

## Plan

Order \ Get them up (All the components that would be required) -> Get everything ready on an clean organised desk
-> Follow the simple instructions as on the blog (https://learn.adafruit.com/tron-hoodie/) + video (https://learn.adafruit.com/tron-hoodie/) 
-> Tada ! The hoodie is made 

Once this project I would move on to another one which could look in the relams of the following 
(I will update the repo and make sure I am communicating what I am doing as I go) - 

- Tron Sneakers (https://learn.adafruit.com/glowing-star-chucks)
- RGB Bag (https://learn.adafruit.com/matrix-portal-rgb-display-handbag) / Tron Laptop Bag (https://learn.adafruit.com/tron-bag) 
- Mechanical Keyboard (Using a barebone to start from)
- Anything else that is quick + easy + has utility

# Custom Mechanical Keyboard 

## Summary

For my second project , I plan on making a mechanical keyboard. I have never have had / made one before and think this is a good place to start from
without  losing my mind selecting a 5 parts out of millions + (due to inexperience in soldering and pcb design :/ ) 
Reason why I carefully selected this  - 
Should work with windows + linus + mac 
Should be wireless
Should be RGB for night use 
= heaven ! 


## Plan

Order all the components that would be required -> Get everything ready on an clean organised desk
-> Follow the simple instructions as in the video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SZZ-2Zkg9c - kinda following this guy's process not the parts) +
create some simple programs in order to get specified keys to do the task of my choices 
-> Tada ! The Mechanical Keyboard is made
